# Test

This repo is just a test dummy. A way to test & prove that we have taken control of the `toolbox` vendor name on Packagist.

Big BIG thanks to the original owner, [Anthonius Munthi](https://itstoni.com/) for being such a great guy, and handing the domain on a golden platter. I wish there were more people like him on the interwebz.

Anyway, this will get deleted at some point. And it has zero utility. 

Watch out for toolbox/toolbox, that's the thing you'll want to look at ðŸ˜‰
